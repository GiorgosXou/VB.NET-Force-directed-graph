# [VB.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET) Force directed graph 
with { +GPU, +DirectX, +GPU GUI Example of buttons}

A Simple but also quite powerful and Beautiful [Force directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) made with Love for an upcoming project of mine and for everyone out there that needs some help over graph visualization in Visual Basic [...]
+<img src="/GraphVisual.gif">

# Features

- Uses [Cudafy.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA)  for GPGPU calculation of forces.
- GUI like Interactions Using [DirectX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX) for Drawing Stuffs.
- CPU Parallel algorithms for the rest of Graph interactions.
- OpenCL CudafyTranslator for plenty of GPU Cards support.
- Runs on ```NET Framework 4.0``` ! (‚úì on Windows XP simulation).

# ```Important```

- ```Notes``` (at the Bottom of .md).
- Code is really not at all, optimized!
- Code will be "recreated" once i end with my other stuffs if not anyone‚ù§Ô∏é remake it until then.
- If you have Error Code.. S1023 when installing DirectX SDK, uninstall c++ 2010 redistributables.
- Check ["Remove integer overflow checks"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33742792/does-anyone-had-ever-successfully-utilized-cudafy-in-vb-net) under Project Properties > Compile > Advanced Compile Options > Optimizations. Else CUDAfy code wont Compile.

# Features I Wish For 
```Considering my knowledge at this moment [...]```
- Easy :
  -
  -- Thickness Of Lines, Based on Connections or etc.<br/>
  -- Size Of Node, Based on  Connections or etc.<br/>
  -- [...]<br/>

- Medium:
  -
  -- generally Low Level Grapchics<br/>
  -- Clustering algorithms<br/>
  -- Faster Algorithms<br/>

- Hard :
  -
  -- *3D Graph visualization*.<br/>
  -- *Make it as a Form **Control***. <br/>
  -- Recreation of most of the controls using DirectX.<br/>

# ```Notes```

Please Dont blame me for my ü¶Üed ‚òùÔ∏è üìÑcode :/ i had some difficult time, overcoming some things...so, i would say that, even if i had the whole summer quite free, i had not as much time,  as i would want to have in order to focus on this part of my project, way much more[...] +really wanted to upload it, before the end of summer holidays; thats why i am uploading it now, even if it is way to weirdly written. With hope that a "good samaritan" will find it intresting and fulfill my wishes.

With Love to all of you out there, George.
